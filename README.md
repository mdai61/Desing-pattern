Predicting H1 Target for November 2024: A
Predictive Modeling Project with OOP &
Design Patterns
Overview
This project extends a previous predictive modeling implementation by incorporating object￾
oriented programming (OOP) principles and software design patterns. It enhances code
maintainability, reusability, and scalability while maintaining the original goal of forecasting
target categories based on historical OHLCV data resampled into the H1 (1-hour)
timeframe.
Key improvements:
 Refactored Codebase: Uses OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance,
polymorphism, abstraction).
 Design Patterns: Implemented Template Method, Strategy, and Decorator patterns.
 Graphical User Interface (GUI): Integrated Kivy-based UI for model selection and
execution.
 Automated Testing: Developed unit tests for trainers and visualizers.
 WHL Packaging: Created a distributable Python package (.whl) for easy installation.
Target Categories
The target categories are based on the percentage change in the Close price over the next 10
H1 candles:
 A: (< -5%)
 B: (-5% to -2%)
 C: (-2% to +2%)
 D: (+2% to +5%)
 E: (> +5%)
Additionally, a momentum target based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was
implemented.
Dataset
The dataset consists of historical M1 (1-minute) OHLCV data, resampled into H1 (1-hour)
data. It includes:
 OHLCV Features: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume aggregated over 1-hour intervals.
 Engineered Features: Lagged values, moving averages, RSI-based momentum metrics.
Key Improvements in This Project
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
 Encapsulation: Modularized code into separate classes (DataProcessor, ModelTrainer,
FeatureSelector, Visualizer).
 Inheritance: Shared functionality implemented in abstract base classes (BaseTrainer,
BaseVisualizer), extended by concrete classes (XGBoostTrainer, XGBoostVisualizer).
 Polymorphism: Training and visualization are dynamically handled through abstract
base classes, enabling easy extensibility.
 Abstraction: High-level classes define workflows while leaving implementation details
to subclasses.
2. Design Patterns Used
 Template Method Pattern:
o BaseTrainer defines a high-level workflow for model training (preprocessing
→ training → evaluation → logging).
o Concrete implementations (XGBoostTrainer) handle specific implementations.
 Strategy Pattern:
o Training strategies are encapsulated in separate trainer classes, allowing easy
swapping or extension.
 Decorator Pattern:
o The log_results decorator dynamically adds logging functionality to
evaluation methods without modifying their core logic.
3. GUI Integration with Kivy
A Kivy-based graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to allow users to:
 Select start and end dates for dataset filtering.
 Choose a test period for model evaluation.
 Run the model and visualize results dynamically (confusion matrix and performance
metrics).
4. Automated Testing
 Unit tests were developed for the XGBoostTrainer and XGBoostVisualizer classes.
 Tests ensure data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization work
correctly.
5. WHL Packaging for Easy Distribution
 The project was packaged into a .whl (Wheel) file using setuptools for easy
distribution and installation.
